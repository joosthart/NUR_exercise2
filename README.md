# NUR_exercise1
Solutions to exercise 1 of the course Numerical Recipes for Astrophysics (fall 2020).

## Usage
All code is run from the `run.sh` script. Running the code is as easy as
    
    ./run.sh

This command will generate a pdf-file, `solutions.pdf`, which contains a report of the answers to the problems in `NUR2020_Handin1.pdf`. Furthermore, a short movie will be generated, `coolingrate.mp4`. All plots and code outputs are saved in `./plots` and `./outputs`, respectively.
